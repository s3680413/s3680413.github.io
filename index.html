 <h2><center>Interest in IT</center></h2>   
<p>The spirit of wanting to learn about technology starts when I was in secondary school where we learned how to manage and store data 
online. Learning about these stuffs makes me interested in database management and cloud computing and security. In addition to that, having 
lot of network and computer issues back in my island makes me interested in learning more about computer problems and how to solve the problems. </p>

<p>Choosing my University was not my choice, it was an allocation by the government.</p>

<p>During my study here in RMIT, I expect to learn different kind of technology skills. Apart from technology skills and theories, I also expect to 
learn different kind of skills such as communication (writing & speaking), collaboration, etc that will help me in the future getting a job. </p>
