 <h2><center>Interest in IT</center></h2>   
<p>The spirit of wanting to learn about technology starts when I was in secondary school where we learned how to manage and store data 
online. Learning about these stuffs makes me interested in database management and cloud computing and security. In addition to that, having 
lot of network and computer issues back in my island makes me interested in learning more about computer problems and how to solve the problems. </p>

<p>Choosing my University was not my choice, it was an allocation by the government.</p>

<p>During my study here in RMIT, I expect to learn different kind of technology skills. Apart from technology skills and theories, I also expect to 
learn different kind of skills such as communication (writing & speaking), collaboration, etc that will help me in the future getting a job. </p><br>

 <h2><center>Ideal Job</center></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38577032?searchrequesttoken=92a50213-fac4-4148-a834-449237f3ef53&type=standard">IT Help Desk</a><br></p>

<p>The job holder will be responsible for troubleshooting or configuring network problems, repairing computer hardware (system unit, mouse, CPU, etc).
 Apart from that, they are also responsible for installing software into computers when needed by the company or clients. Back in my island, the 
 government workers have lots of problems with computers and networks. For instance, most of the workers computers are not working, some complained 
 that the network is too slow, and they need to install and run software on their computers, but they find it difficult to do. So, by reading this job, it 
 makes me want to do this kind of job as it is needed as well in my island. </p>
 
 <p>Skills needed for these jobs is collaboration, i.e. you must be able to work in a group. Also have to be critical thinking and know how to solve
 problems. In addition, communication skill also one of the most important skill required for this position. Employers are needed to have a good 
 communication so that they can explain clearly and properly the problems to the customers or users, and the using of the computers. And you must have 
 a certificate or degree in Help Desk. Furthermore, this job holder must have at least two years of work experience in any company or organisation.</p>

<p>Currently, I do not have any IT qualification and skills required for this position. As for experience, even though I had one year of work experience 
in an IT Department back home, but still not suitable or fit for this position. </p>

<p>I need to complete a master in IT (Help Desk) in order to get qualification for this position. In addition to that, I need to do more practicals activities 
related to this position, such as volunteering and internship. Furthermore, I also need to study a lot by myself, by reading notes and by taking online courses.</p><br><hr>

 <h2><center>Personal Profile</center></h2>
 <p><h3><u><i>Results of Myer-Briggs Test</i></u></h3></p>
<p>Practical, realistic, matter-of-fact. Decisive, quickly move to implement decisions. Organize projects and people
 to get things done, focus on getting results in the most efficient way possible. Take care of routine details. Have 
 a clear set of logical standards, systematically follow them and want others to also. Forceful in implementing their plans</p><br>
 
 <p><h3><u><i>Result of Learning Style online test</i></u></h3></p>
 <p>ENFJs are driven by their desire to help others reach their fullest potential. They are affectionate, charismatic and deeply caring.
 ENFJs feel called to enrich the world with their altruistic contributions. They are often called upon to help others in times of need. 
 ENFJs direct their energy outward. They are gregarious, talkative and assertive. They love people and social gatherings. They are
 energized by interaction, are expressive and enthusiastic. Mentors are Intuitive. They are imaginative and deep. Their thought process 
 is abstract and focused on possibilities. They are idealistic and complex people. ENFJs are Feelers that make decisions with their heart.
 They are passionate and profoundly empathetic, caring and warm. ENFJs are decisive, organized and structured. They like to complete tasks

 <p><h3><u><i>Result of the 16 Personalities online test</i></u></h3></p>
 <p>Defender - Defender personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, 
 they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. Defenders take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, 
 doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home. The challenge for Defenders is ensuring that what they do is noticed.
 They have a tendency to underplay their accomplishments, and while their kindness is often respected, more cynical and selfish people are likely to 
 take advantage of Defenders dedication and humbleness by pushing work onto them and then taking the credit. Defenders need to know when to say no
 and stand up for themselves if they are to maintain their confidence and enthusiasm.</p><br>
 
 <p>These tests results mean that there are still some kind of my personalities that are not needed in group working or in workplaces. That means 
 that I need to change and improve some areas of my life which are not fit in workplaces. For instance, my aversion to conflict can be mistreated 
 by some of my colleagues in the workplace or in a team work. So, I must be more argumentative so that I will not be abused by team members. The results 
 show that being too humble and shy in a workplace will not help me.Working in a group with people of different cultures and different personalities is not
 easy. According to the results, I can become overworked and stressed because the team members know that I (Defender) will never say no. So, when forming a team, 
 it is very importatnt ot take into account to get to know each other personality before working together. </p><br><hr>


 <h2><center>Project Idea</center></h2>

<h3><u>Project Summary</u></h3>
<p>The project is about a mobile flight app. This project is mainly designed to be used by adults. The app will include a QR code where travellers 
can use it to scan and check in through the application rather than standing in a long queue waiting for their turn. The app will also display all 
different flight details such as flight number, flight fare, departure date and so on. In addition, they also can look up on the app for different
 airlines and receive holiday packages that will suit their preference.</p>

<p><h3><u>Motivation</u></h3></p>
<p>This project is useful to customers in many ways. First of all, it provides convenience to customers. Many airlines require 
passengers to be at the airport four hours before boarding time to check in their luggage, get their boarding pass and seat number, etc. 
This app helps customers to take their time to get boarding pass, seat number at their own convenience. And especially to customers who 
always in a rush but do not have any baggage to check in. In addition to that, it also disseminates information faster. For example, there 
will be changes to departure time, flight gates and sometimes it quite hard to hear announcement at the airport. So, having this app will
 help you get notifications and updates about these changes. </p>
 
 <p><h3><u>Features of the Project</u></h3></p>
 <p>First of all, one feature of this app is <b><i>Flight Tracker</i></b>. This feature is for tracking flights. This includes, how far you are from your 
 departure place, destination, also display the arrival time, nearest destination and so forth. It also allows passengers to track how long they 
 have been travelling, how far is from their destination and the total distance of their flight. Apart from that, this feature also allows 
 passengers to track multiple flights. For example, if you are on a different flight with your friend, you can check what time she/he will 
 arrive at the airport. Another feature is <b><i>Trip Planner</i></b>. The users are able to plan their trips on this app. Travellers may save their future
 and past trips using this feature. In addition to that, <b><i>App guidance</b></i> is another one. Guidelines and tips are helpfully shown in this app to 
 guide people. This is the most important feature in the app which will help the user to get familiar with using the app. It provide information of how to
 track the flight, using some other features like playing music and movie. This helps in reducing the education of passengers or users of how to use the app.
 Furthermore, <b><i>PushUp Notification</b></i> is another feature. It will help the travellers updated with any changes  to their flights. But first, the users
 must make sure that their notifications is switch on so that they will not miss any updates.</p>
 
 <p><h3><u>Tools Required for the Project</u></h3></p>
 <p>One of the software needed in this project is Java. Java is one of the programming languages used when creating apps. To create a flight app, 
 the developer will use this software to program how the app is going to work. Solarwinds msp is another software required for this. This software
 will be used for backing up data stored in this app. </p>
 
<p><h3><u>Skills required</u></h3></p>
<p>Some of the skills required for this project are: UX/UI Design Skills, Cross-platform Development skill, expert in programming and so on. In order to get to obtain these
skills, online courses are one way to help  you. Instead of going to a face to face course, looking up online for online courses will makes it easier to gain these skills.
 In addition, practical is another way of getting the skills. For programming, theoretical learning is not enough, putting something into practice everyday will help you
 gain valuable skills. For instance, volunteer and internship will assist you in gaining the skills required for this project. Practising a lot makes everything 
perfect and easy.</p>

<p><h3><u>Outcome</u></h3></p>
<p>If the project is successful, I hope that it will ease the process for travellers to check-in their flight through the application and giving them holiday 
promotions. Furthermore, I also expect that by finishing this project, the travellers will no longer rush to the airport and no longer have problems (delays, cancellation)
with their flights. The impact of this project is that it will take up some opportunities for people working at the airport. If all the travellers are using this app for 
 checking in, that means that the workers (check-in workers) will no longer needed in the workplace.</p>
