 <p><h3><u><i>Result of the 16 Personalities online test</i></u></h3></p>
 <p>Defender - Defender personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, 
 they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. Defenders take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, 
 doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home. The challenge for Defenders is ensuring that what they do is noticed.
 They have a tendency to underplay their accomplishments, and while their kindness is often respected, more cynical and selfish people are likely to 
 take advantage of Defenders dedication and humbleness by pushing work onto them and then taking the credit. Defenders need to know when to say no
 and stand up for themselves if they are to maintain their confidence and enthusiasm.</p><br>
 
 <p>These tests results mean that there are still some kind of my personalities that are not needed in group working or in workplaces. That means 
 that I need to change and improve some areas of my life which are not fit in workplaces. For instance, my aversion to conflict can be mistreated 
 by some of my colleagues in the workplace or in a team work. So, I must be more argumentative so that I will not be abused by team members. The results 
 show that being too humble and shy in a workplace will not help me.Working in a group with people of different cultures and different personalities is not
 easy. According to the results, I can become overworked and stressed because the team members know that I (Defender) will never say no. So, when forming a team, 
 it is very importatnt ot take into account to get to know each other personality before working together. </p><br>
